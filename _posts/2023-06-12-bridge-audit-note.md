# Common Security issues

## About Smart Contract

### Re-use signature

Must assign flag used for tx hash or using nonce increment

### Re-use on multi-chain

Must have from chain ID and to chain ID in signed message

## About backend

### Duplicate on listener

Example: Listen event from block 10 to block 30 with “block size” 10.

- Loop 1: from 10 to 20
- Loop 2:
    - Incorrect: from 20 to 30 ❌
    - Correct: from 21 to 30 ✅

Incorrect case, tx in block 20 is duplicated.

### Confirm Block

Dev must wait “confirm block” (at least 12-13 block) for validated chain.

On ARB, Dev must listen event from batch.

## Checklist

[portfolio/BridgeSecurityChecklist.md at master · spearbit/portfolio](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/content/bridges/BridgeSecurityChecklist.md)

### Bridge type

- [ ]  **Lock and mint:** User locks tokens in a smart contract on the source chain, then wrapped versions of those locked tokens are minted on the destination chain as a form of IOU.
- [ ]  **Burn and mint:** User burns tokens on the source chain, then the same native tokens are re-issued (minted) on the destination chain.
- [ ]  **Liquidity Pool:** A user locks tokens on the source chain, then unlocks the same native tokens from a liquidity pool on the destination chain.
- [ ]  **Hybrid:** For some tokens it acts as Lock/Burn-and-mint, for others acts as a Liquidity Pool.

### Centralization

- [ ]  **Trusted:** Trusted bridges depend upon a central entity or system for their operations. They have trust assumptions with respect to the custody of funds and the security of the bridge. Users mostly rely on the bridge operator’s reputation. Users need to give up control of their crypto assets.
- [ ]  **Trust-Minimized:** Trust-minimized bridges operate using smart contracts and algorithms. They are trustless, i.e., the security of the bridge is the same as that of the underlying blockchain. Through smart contracts, trust-minimized bridges enable users to remain in control of their funds.

### What does the bridge connect into?

- [ ]  L1 <> L1.
- [ ]  L1 <> L2.
- [ ]  L2 <> L2.

- [ ]  List chains:

### How are messages sent from the bridge validated

- [ ]  **Externally verified:** Third party (EOA, MultiSig, intermediary blockchain with their own set of validators).

- [ ]  **Optimistically verified:** Message considered valid until proven otherwise by 1/*n* watchers during the time of the fault proof window.
- [ ]  **Canonical:** Messages are validated by Ethereum smart contracts or possibly via the protocol itself) i.g., Optimistic Rollups, zkRollups..

| C6.1 | Verify that bridge requires all necessary values to be included in the message and signed: token type, chain ids, receiver, amount, nonce, etc.. |
| C6.2 | Verify that used signatures are invalidated to protect bridge from replay attacks.                                                               |

| C6.4 | Verify that bridge includes source and destination chains identifiers in the signed message and correctly verifies them.                         |
| C6.5 | Verify that bridge does not allow to spoof chain identifier.                                                                                     |
| C6.6 | Verify that bridge uses a nonce parameter to allow the same operation (the same sender, receiver and amount) to be executed multiple times.      |
